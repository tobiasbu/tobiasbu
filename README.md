### Hey! I'm Tobias. 👋

I'm software and game developer from Brazil. 

I consider myself a generalist programmer working with different solutions and technologies over 8+ years of professional experience. My main interests are explore technical implementations of game engines, software architecture and develop interactive/graphical applications.
